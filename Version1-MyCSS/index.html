	    <h3>Introduction:</h3>
    	<p>Basketball is a sport, generally played by two teams of five players on a rectangular court. 
    	The objective is to shoot a ball through a hoop 18 inches (46 cm) in diameter and 10 feet (3.048 m) 
    	high mounted to a backboard at each end.</p>

    	<p>A team can score a field goal by shooting the ball through the basket during regular play. 
    	A field goal scores three points for the shooting team if the player shoots from behind the three-point line, 
    	and two points if shot from in front of the line. A team can also score via free throws, 
    	which are worth one point, after the other team is assessed with certain fouls. 
    	The team with the most points at the end of the game wins, but additional time (overtime) 
    	is issued when the score is tied at the end of regulation. The ball can be advanced on the court by throwing it 
    	to a teammate, or by bouncing it while walking or running (dribbling). It is a violation to lift, or drag, 
    	one's pivot foot without dribbling the ball, to carry it, or to hold the ball with both hands then resume dribbling.</p>

    	<p>Basketball is one of the world's most popular and widely viewed sports.
    	The National Basketball Association (NBA) is the most popular and widely considered to be the highest 
    	level of professional basketball in the world and NBA players are the world's best paid sportsmen, 
    	by average annual salary per player. Outside North America, the top clubs from national leagues 
    	qualify to continental championships such as the Euroleague and FIBA Americas League. 
    	The FIBA Basketball World Cup attracts the top national teams from around the world. 
    	Each continent hosts regional competitions for national teams, like EuroBasket and FIBA Americas Championship.</p>
